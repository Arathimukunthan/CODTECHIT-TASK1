Key Points
Interactive UI: Clean and responsive interface that enables easy navigation.
Dynamic Data: Displays current temperature, humidity, and wind speed by fetching real-time data.
Iconography: Uses icons that change based on weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).
Error Handling: Shows an error message when an invalid city name is entered.

Technology Used
HTML: For structuring the webpage.
CSS: For styling the weather card, search box, and icons.
JavaScript: For API integration and handling user input and data display.
OpenWeatherMap API: For retrieving up-to-date weather information.

Conclusion
The Weather App effectively provides real-time weather details with a straightforward and intuitive interface.
It demonstrates how to work with APIs, manage asynchronous requests, and dynamically update the UI based on user input and fetched data.
