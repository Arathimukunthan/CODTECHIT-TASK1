Objectives:
To develop a simple and user-friendly weather application.
To allow users to check real-time weather information for any city.
To provide key weather details (temperature, humidity, wind speed) with error handling for incorrect city names.

Key Points:
Interactive UI: Clean and responsive interface that enables easy navigation.
Dynamic Data: Displays current temperature, humidity, and wind speed by fetching real-time data.
Iconography: Uses icons that change based on weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).
Error Handling: Shows an error message when an invalid city name is entered.

Technology Used:
HTML: For structuring the webpage.
CSS: For styling the weather card, search box, and icons.
JavaScript: For API integration and handling user input and data display.
OpenWeatherMap API: For retrieving up-to-date weather information.

Conclusion:
The Weather App effectively provides real-time weather details with a straightforward and intuitive interface. It demonstrates how to work with APIs, manage asynchronous requests, and dynamically update the UI based on user input and fetched data.
